    <h1>Formation Evaluation</h1>

<p>Formation evaluation is a critical discipline in the field of geology, geophysics, and petroleum engineering. It involves the systematic assessment and analysis of subsurface rock formations to gather essential data and information about their composition, properties, and potential for hydrocarbon exploration and production.</p>

<h2>Why Formation Evaluation Matters</h2>

<p>Formation evaluation is essential for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hydrocarbon Exploration:</strong> In the oil and gas industry, one of the primary objectives is to locate and extract hydrocarbon reserves from beneath the Earth's surface. Formation evaluation helps determine the presence, quality, and quantity of these reserves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Characterization:</strong> Understanding the characteristics of subsurface formations is crucial for reservoir characterization. This includes identifying the type of rock, porosity, permeability, fluid content, and pressure gradients within the reservoir, which are vital for efficient extraction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well Planning and Drilling:</strong> Formation evaluation guides the planning and drilling of wells. It helps select suitable drilling locations, anticipate formation challenges, and optimize drilling techniques to maximize productivity and minimize costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Management:</strong> Once a well is in production, ongoing formation evaluation assists in reservoir management. It helps monitor changes in reservoir conditions over time, optimize production strategies, and make informed decisions regarding well interventions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods and Technologies</h2>

<p>Formation evaluation relies on a range of methods and technologies, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formation Evaluation While Drilling:</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Mostly, the MWD, measurements while drilling, name is reserved for the measurements related to well construction rather than to formation evaluation. </p></li>
<li>The sensors in LWD are integrated into drill collars and the logging measurements are made while the well is being drilled.</li>
<li>Both MWD and LWD systems are based on mud telemetry where pressure variations in the mud pulse exercised by the tool are sensed by a computer on surface.</li>
<li>Sometimes data may also be recorded downhole and retrieved when the drill string is removed from the hole.</li>
<li>MWD tools use accelerometer and magnetometers which measure the tool orientation with respect to the earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields and this data is then converted into wellbore inclination and direction by a surface system.</li>
<li><p>There are LWD sensors now available that are competitive with, and in some cases exceed, the capabilities of wireline logging sensors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mud Logging:</strong> The mud logger’s sources of data include gas extracted from the mud at the gas trap, cuttings collected at the shale shaker, and gas liberated from cuttings in the blender. The types of measurement possible include total gas concentration, from either the mud or the cuttings, chromatographic gas analysis, visual inspection of cuttings by normal and ultraviolet light, and calcimetry for carbonate analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Hole Well Logging:</strong> Logging tools are lowered into a wellbore to record measurements of various formation properties, such as resistivity, porosity, gamma radiation, and rock density.</p></li>
<li><p>Well logging is the practice of making a detailed record of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole. It can be either while drilling or after production started.</p></li>
<li>They are universally recorded in practically all wellbores and can be directly related to all the other parameters available from the associated sciences.</li>
<li>Log measurements, when properly calibrated, can provide most of the parameters required: lithology, porosity, both primary and secondary (fractures and vugs), water saturation and hydrocarbon movability, hydrocarbon type (oil, gas, or condensate), permeability, formation dip and structure, sedimentary environment, etc.</li>
<li>In producing wells, logging can provide measurements of flow rates, fluid type, pressure, residual oil saturation.</li>
<li><p>Logging survey can be carried while drilling (LWD) or after drilling (wireline logging).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coring and Core Analysis:</strong> Extracting and analyzing core samples from wells allows for direct examination of rock properties and fluid content.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Two methods of obtaining cores are frequently used:</p>

<ul>
<li>In one, an assembly called a core barrel is made up on the drill string and run to the bottom of the hole. As the core barrel is rotated, it cuts a cylindrical core a few inches in diameter that is received in a tube above the core-cutting bit. A complete round trip is required for each core taken.</li>
<li><p>The second is a sidewall sampler in which a small explosive charge is fired to ram a small cylinder into the wall of the hole. When the tool is pulled out of the hole, the small core samples come out with the tool. Up to thirty of the small samples can be taken at any desired depth. Either type of core can be examined in a laboratory and may reveal much about the nature of the reservoir. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Petrophysical Analysis:</strong> Petrophysicists interpret well logs and core data to calculate properties like water saturation, hydrocarbon volume, and reservoir quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wireline Formation Testing:</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Enable limited samples of formation fluid to be sucked out of the formation and brought to the surface for further analysis.</p></li>
<li>Gauging formation permeability</li>
<li>It also enable multiple formation pressure tests to be performed in one run into the hole.</li>
<li>These can be used to compute fluid pressure gradients and thus determine precisely gas/oil, gas/water and oil/water contact regions.</li>
<li>Modern tools include quartz-crystal pressure gauges (accuracy 1 psi and resolution 0.01 psi) and pretest capabilities that allow the operator to rectify a bad seal before it leads to undesirable results.</li>
<li><p>Modern tools also include optical fluid analyzers which can inform the operator before sampling whether the fluid flowing from the formation is oil or water.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drill Stem Testing:</strong></p></li>
<li><p>To ascertain whether the formation can achieve sustained production</p></li>
<li>To establish the type of production (oil or gas)</li>
<li>To collect formation fluids for laboratory analysis (e.g., PVT, water salinity)</li>
<li>To establish formation pressure</li>
<li><p>To estimate formation permeability</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Geological and Geophysical Modeling:</strong> Computer modeling techniques help create three-dimensional representations of subsurface formations, aiding in reservoir characterization and simulation.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Integrated Formation Evaluation Plan</h2>

<ul>
<li>The geophysicist must plan where to run seismic lines, quality check the actual shooting, and then interpret the data to assist in choosing a drilling location.</li>
<li>The geologist and the geochemist must work together to map the locations of traps, reservoir rocks, and source rocks. They answer the questions like where the rocks have come from (their origin), what they are made of (their composition) and how the rocks are arranged in strata.</li>
<li>The drilling engineer must plan how the well is to be drilled and supervise the drilling process and any testing or completion work.</li>
<li>The reservoir engineer must work with the petrophysicist to provide the manager with reserves figures and production-decline estimates so that logical economic decisions can be made regarding field development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges and Innovations</h2>

<p>Formation evaluation faces challenges related to complex geological structures, wellbore conditions, and evolving technology. However, ongoing innovations in sensors, data analytics, and artificial intelligence are continually improving the accuracy and efficiency of formation evaluation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, formation evaluation is a critical component of the energy industry, guiding exploration and production efforts, optimizing well performance, and contributing to the sustainable management of hydrocarbon reservoirs. It combines various techniques and technologies to unravel the secrets hidden beneath the Earth's surface, ultimately supporting the responsible and efficient extraction of energy resources.</p>

        <h2>Petrophysics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Petrophysics is suggested as the term pertaining to the physics of a particular rock type, whereas geophysics pertains to the physics of larger rock systems composing the earth.</li>
<li>It studies physical and chemical rock properties; pore size distribution and their interaction with fluids; fluid distribution of each phase (oil, gas, water) within the pores of the rock.</li>
<li>The petrophysical properties that are discussed include: porosity, saturation, absolute-effective-relative permeability, capillary pressure, wettability, compressibility, mineralogy, etc.</li>
<li>Petrophysicists are employed to help reservoir engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons.</li>
<li>A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, core measurements and seismic measurements.</li>
<li>These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rock Types</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Igneous Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed from molten material called magma that solidified upon cooling either at the surface or below the surface. Igneous rocks are the most abundant rocks on the Earth’s crust.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metamorphic Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed by transformation, generally in the solid state, of pre-existing rocks beneath the surface by heat, pressure, and chemically active fluids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sedimentary Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed at the surface of the Earth either by accumulation and consolidation of minerals, rocks, organisms and vegetation, or precipitation from solution. Sedimentary rocks are the source of petroleum and provide the reservoir rock and trap to hold the petroleum in the Earth’s crust.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conventional Reservoir Rocks</h2>

<ul>
<li>A rock capable of producing oil, gas and water is called a reservoir rock.</li>
<li>To be of commercial value, a reservoir rock must have sufficient thickness, areal extent and pore space to contain a large volume of hydrocarbons and must yield the contained fluids at a satisfactory rate when the reservoir is penetrated by a well.</li>
<li>The movement of the fluids is influenced by gravity and capillary forces.</li>
<li>Sandstone and carbonates are the most common reservoir rocks. They together contain most of the world’s petroleum reserves.</li>
<li>The formation of petroleum reach rocks is a long geological process where the several crucial components are crucial.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sandstone Reservoirs</h2>

<ul>
<li>These reservoirs belong to clastic group.</li>
<li>The pore space of sandstone reservoirs can be affected by varying degrees of compaction, cementation, solution and replacement.</li>
<li>Theoretically, grain size has no effect on porosity. This is true only for spherical grains of the same size. However, the arrangement of such spheres has a large effect on the porosity of the pack.</li>
<li>Porosity is at its maximum for spherical grains but becomes progressively less as the angularity of the grains increases because such grains pack together more closely.</li>
<li>Porosities of wet packed sands show a general decrease as sorting becomes poorer. </li>
<li>Compaction and cementation decrease the porosity in the formation process of rock.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Carbonate Reservoirs</h2>

<ul>
<li>These reservoirs belong to chemical group.</li>
<li>They differ from clastic group in that they are deposited as lime particles which are produced locally, whereas sandstones are composed of particles transported from an outside source by water currents.</li>
<li>They differ even more importantly from sandstones by being subject to more post-depositional diagenesis ranging from simple cementation of original particles to complete recrystallization or replacement by dolomite or chert.</li>
<li>Diagenesis is the process of physical and chemical changes in sediments after deposition that convert them to consolidated rock such as compaction, cementation, recrystallization, and perhaps replacement of original mineral as in the development of dolomite.</li>
<li>Good porosity in carbonate reservoirs is usually due to dolomitization. Dolomitization CaMg(CO3)2 occurs from the substitution of magnesium for calcium in carbonate crystal (CaCO3). A volume loss of 12-13% results in corresponding increase in porosity.</li>
<li>Natural fractures can exist in essentially any type of rock although they are particularly common in carbonates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unconventional Reservoir Rock</h2>

<p>Unconventional reservoirs are essentially any reservoir that requires special recovery operations outside the conventional operating practices.</p>

<p>They include reservoirs such as tight-gas sands, gas and oil shales, coalbed methane, heavy oil and tar sands and gas-hydrate deposits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tight gas is the term commonly used to refer to low-permeability reservoirs that produce mainly dry natural gas.</li>
<li>Shale oil refers to hydrocarbons that are trapped in formations of shale rock.</li>
<li>Oil shale is different than shale oil in that oil shale is essentially rock that contains a compound called kerogen, which is used to make oil.</li>
<li>Coalbed methane is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds.
Tar sands (also called oil sands) are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen. Bitumen is a thick, sticky, black oil that can form naturally in a variety of ways, usually when lighter oil is degraded by bacteria.</li>
<li>Gas hydrates are ice-like crystalline minerals that form when low molecular weight gas (such as methane, ethane, or carbon dioxide) combines with water and freezes into a solid under low temperature and moderate pressure conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These reservoirs require assertive recovery solutions such as stimulation treatments or steam injection, innovative solutions that must overcome economic constraints in order to make recovery from these reservoirs monetarily viable. </p>

        <h2>Core Analysis</h2>

<p>Petrophysics has a major application in petroleum industry and is employed to help engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons. A major role of petrophysicists is to measure and evaluate rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, in which a string of measurement tools is inserted in the borehole, core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface for the laboratory measurements, and seismic measurements, in which reflected seismic waves are recorded to image subsurface structures. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.</p>

In this course, we will focus on the first way of acquiring data from underground formations and will look at the specific methodologies used in current field applications.</p>

<p>From the formation evaluation perspective, logging by itself cannot answer all questions, but it has certain unique advantages over the other formation evaluation techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>It provides most abundant data from the formation.</li>
<li>It is a reliable in-situ measurement technique providing vertical and lateral variations in rock and fluid properties.</li>
<li>It is a modest cost technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain disadvantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indirect measurement</li>
<li>Limited depth of investigation</li>
<li>Vertical resolution</li>
<li>Nuclear hazards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Well Log Interpretation</h3>

<p>Interpretation steps are:</p>

    <h1>Reservoir Engineering</h1>

<p>Reservoir engineering is a specialized field within petroleum engineering focused on the management and optimization of hydrocarbon reservoirs. It plays a critical role in the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves.</p>

<h2>The Significance of Reservoir Engineering</h2>

<p>Reservoir engineering is crucial for several key reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> It aims to maximize the recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. This is essential for economic viability and energy supply.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Characterization:</strong> Reservoir engineers work to understand the physical properties of the reservoir, including porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and pressure, to design effective production strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well and Facility Design:</strong> Reservoir engineers play a pivotal role in designing wells and production facilities to ensure efficient hydrocarbon extraction while minimizing costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Management:</strong> Over the life of a reservoir, continuous monitoring and optimization are required to maintain production rates and extend the economic life of the asset.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Aspects of Reservoir Engineering</h2>

<p>Reservoir engineering encompasses various key aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Modeling:</strong> Reservoir engineers build mathematical models of subsurface reservoirs using data from well logs, seismic surveys, and core samples. These models help predict reservoir behavior and guide production decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fluid Flow Analysis:</strong> Understanding the movement of fluids (oil, gas, and water) within the reservoir is essential. Reservoir engineers use principles of fluid dynamics to optimize production techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well Testing:</strong> Well tests provide valuable data about reservoir properties and help evaluate the performance of individual wells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR):</strong> Reservoir engineers explore techniques like water flooding, gas injection, and chemical flooding to enhance oil recovery from mature reservoirs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reservoir Surveillance:</strong> Continuous monitoring of reservoir conditions ensures that production strategies remain effective and that issues such as pressure depletion or water encroachment are addressed promptly.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges and Innovations</h2>

<p>Reservoir engineering faces challenges related to complex geological structures, uncertainty in reservoir data, and environmental considerations. To address these challenges, innovations in technology, data analytics, and reservoir simulation software have become increasingly important.</p>

<h2>Sustainability and Responsible Management</h2>

<p>In today's energy landscape, sustainability and environmental responsibility are paramount. Reservoir engineers play a role in ensuring that hydrocarbon extraction is conducted with a focus on minimizing environmental impact, reducing emissions, and managing resources responsibly.</p>

<p>In summary, reservoir engineering is a multidisciplinary field that bridges geology, fluid dynamics, and engineering principles. It is vital for optimizing the recovery of hydrocarbon resources, extending the life of reservoirs, and aligning energy production with sustainability goals.</p>

    <h2>Python Pros</h2>

<p>Python is the best fit for the scientific computing because of the several reasons mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is operating system independent; one can use the same script for Windows, Linux based systems and Mac.</li>
<li>It has one of largest and fastest-growing society where you can get support wherever you are stuck.</li>
<li>It is a user-friendly language; learning python is much easier than learning C or any other low-level programming language.</li>
<li>It has necessary packages for scientific computation, google NumPy for array operations, SciPy for math, scikit-learn for data science, etc.</li>
<li>It takes much less time to develop a program in python. Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year.</li>
<li>It is free! MATLAB is not, and more often the license will limit access to your work especially when you start working in the company.</li>
<li>It is more than a scientific computation tool, you can do pretty much everything with python. For example, you can develop a webpage, do image processing, program a robot, etc.</li>
<li>It has all the necessary tools to perform higher computations, it can handle parallel and series computations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Assuming that you are using Windows not having Python installed yet, below is the link to go over the process:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JJ8-sCwDs4">Python Installation on Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The link below will show you how to install NumPy, one of the most important modules for engineering and scientific calculations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7L72qqFtn8">NumPy Installation for Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Besides NumPy, we will need additional modules, Matplotlib, which is a visualization package used to generate graphs and decorate them, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and SQLite. These modules can be installed pretty much the same way way you had for NumPy.
Finally, check the installation by importing those modules from a python shell, as shown in the link provided.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>There are two main differences between the syntax of Python and other languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python is a case-sensitive language, it distinguishes uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
<li>Python is indentation-sensitive, instead of curly braces, indentation is used to determine beginning and the end of code block. Do not leave unnecessary spaces at the beginning of the line of your script.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version Control</h2>

<p>We are going to use git as a version control system and GitHub as an online repository for our in-class development:</p>

<ul>
<li>Git is version control system for tracking changes in computer files.</li>
<li>It is a distributed version control system which means many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network.</li>
<li>Coordinates work between multiple developers and records changes made.</li>
<li>You can revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it is committed to the repository.</li>
<li>GitHub is a git repository hosting service with its own features easing the access control issues and collaboration efforts.</li>

        <h2>What is matter and how to model its behavior?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of transport of heat, momentum and mass.</li>
<li>In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large enough to allow us to speak of phases which have distinct physical properties. We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts as a continuum.</li>
<li>Most of the time, solving the problems in continuum form is sufficient enough to get accurate results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is mechanics?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mechanics studies the motion of objects and utilizes mathematics to describe the motion of objects, rigid bodies, solids, fluids, etc.</li>
<li>For real bodies, in continuum mechanics, we disregard the molecular structure of matter and picture it as being without gaps or empty spaces. We further suppose that all the mathematical functions entering the theory are continuous functions, except possibly at a finite number of interior surfaces separating regions of continuity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can we describe the motion of any object?</h2>

<p>By utilizing the general principles of continuum mechanics:</p>

<p>| Conservation    | Equation             |
| --------------- |:-------------------- |
| of mass         | Continuity Equation  |
| of momentum     | Equation of Motion   |
| of energy       | Equation of Energy   |</p>

<h2>Why should Petroleum Engineers know about Fluid Mechanics?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Petroleum engineers deal with fluid flow all the time; it can be related to drilling or workover operations or associated with reservoir recovery.</li>
<li>We are dealing with the flow of complex mixtures through the reservoir rock and through the pipelines, and in the system, there is an interaction between gases-and-liquids and liquids-and-solids.</li>
<li>The basic information we might need in the analysis of such systems, pressure and velocity profiles, can be best understood with the knowledge of fluid mechanics.</li>
<li>If we add insight into the thermodynamics, we can dig into the temperature profiles as well.</li>
</ul>
