            <p>Summary and motivation of the courses should be added.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="canvas-item">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Python is the best fit for the scientific computing because of the several reasons mentioned below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is operating system independent; one can use the same script for Windows, Linux based systems and Mac.</li>
              <li>It has one of largest and fastest-growing society where you can get support wherever you are stuck.</li>
              <li>It is a user-friendly language; learning python is much easier than learning C or any other low-level programming language.</li>
              <li>It has necessary packages for scientific computation, google NumPy for array operations, SciPy for math, scikit-learn for data science, etc.</li>
              <li>It takes much less time to develop a program in python. Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year.</li>
              <li>It is free! MATLAB is not, and more often the license will limit access to your work especially when you start working in the company.</li>
              <li>It is more than a scientific computation tool, you can do pretty much everything with python. For example, you can develop a webpage, do image processing, program a robot, etc.</li>
              <li>It has all the necessary tools to perform higher computations, it can handle parallel and series computations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Assuming that you are using Windows not having Python installed yet, below is the link to go over the process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JJ8-sCwDs4">Python Installation on Windows</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The link below will show you how to install NumPy, one of the most important modules for engineering and scientific calculations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7L72qqFtn8">NumPy Installation for Python</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides NumPy, we will need additional modules, Matplotlib, which is a visualization package used to generate graphs and decorate them, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and SQLite. These modules can be installed pretty much the same way way you had for NumPy.</p>
            <p>Finally, check the installation by importing those modules from a python shell, as shown in the link provided.</p>
            <h3>Warning</h3>
            <p>There are two main differences between the syntax of Python and other languages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python is a case-sensitive language, it distinguishes uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
              <li>Python is indentation-sensitive, instead of curly braces, indentation is used to determine beginning and the end of code block. Do not leave unnecessary spaces at the beginning of the line of your script.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Version Control</h3>
            <p>We are going to use git as a version control system and GitHub as an online repository for our in-class development:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Git is version control system for tracking changes in computer files.</li>
              <li>It is a distributed version control system which means many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network.</li>
              <li>Coordinates work between multiple developers and records changes made.</li>
              <li>You can revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it is committed to the repository.</li>
              <li>GitHub is a git repository hosting service with its own features easing the access control issues and collaboration efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Course Outline</h3>
            <p>Below is the list of topics we are going to cover in this course:</p>

            <h3>Fluid Meachanics</h3>
            <p>What is matter and how to model its behavior?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of transport of heat, momentum and mass.</li>
              <li>In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large enough to allow us to speak of phases with physical properties . We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts as a continuum.</li>
              <li>From an engineering standpoint, we are interested in solving problems in continuum form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What is mechanics?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanics studies the motion of objects and utilizes mathematics to describe the motion of objects, rigid bodies, solids, fluids, etc.</li>
              <li>For real bodies, in continuum mechanics, we disregard the molecular structure of matter and picture it as being without gaps or empty spaces. We further suppose that all the mathematical functions entering the theory are continuous functions, except possibly at a finite number of interior surfaces separating regions of continuity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How can we describe the motion of any object?</p>

              <li>Momentum conservation, the use of equation of motion</li>

            <h3>Geostatistics</h3>
            <p>Oil and gas reservoirs are highly heterogeneous. To manage such reservoirs, one must learn and develop a quantitative understanding of statistics and probability. The main objective of this course is to use basic statistical concepts and methods for the characterization and modelling of spatial heterogeneity which has applications in production planning, formation evaluation and reservoir modelling. Students will be encouraged to use high level programming languages (e.g., python and MATLAB) to do the hard work.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="canvas-item">
            <h3>Petrophysics</h3>
            <p>Petrophysics has a major application in petroleum industry and is employed to help engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons. A major role of petrophysicists is to measure and evaluate rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, in which a string of measurement tools is inserted in the borehole, core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface for the laboratory measurements, and seismic measurements, in which reflected seismic waves are recorded to image subsurface structures. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.</p>

            <h3>Well Logging</h3>
            <p>A major role of petrophysicists is to measure and evaluate rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, in which a string of measurement tools is inserted in the borehole, core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface for the laboratory measurements, and seismic measurements, in which reflected seismic waves are recorded to image subsurface structures. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical data, and reservoir engineers utilize this knowledge to describe the dynamic behavior of the reservoir. In this course, we will focus on the first way of acquiring data from underground formations and will look at the specific methodologies used in current field applications.</p>
            <p>From the formation evaluation perspective, logging by itself cannot answer all questions, but it has certain unique advantages over the other formation evaluation techniques:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It provides most abundant data from the formation.</li>
              <li>It is a reliable in-situ measurement technique providing vertical and lateral variations in rock and fluid properties.</li>
              <li>It is a modest cost technique.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Certain disadvantages are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Indirect measurement</li>
              <li>Limited depth of investigation</li>
              <li>Vertical resolution</li>

            <h3>Well Log Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Interpretation steps are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Correlate and depth match logs</li>
              <li>Interpret lithology</li>
              <li>Identify permeable and non-permeable beds on logs</li>
              <li>Divide the beds into water and hydrocarbon bearing zones</li>
              <li>Determine the porosity</li>
              <li>Determine hydrocarbon saturation</li>
