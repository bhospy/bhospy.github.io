### Geostatistical Modeling

Oil and gas reservoirs are highly heterogeneous. To manage such reservoirs, one must learn and develop a quantitative understanding of statistics and probability. The main objective of this course is to use basic statistical concepts and methods for the characterization and modelling of spatial heterogeneity which has applications in production planning, formation evaluation and reservoir modelling. Students will be encouraged to use high level programming languages (e.g., python and MATLAB) to do the hard work.
