## Computational Geomechanics

Conventionally, the reservoir engineers have been using non-deformable reservoirs. In these models, pore volume can still change, but the bulk volume stays the constant, which means the shape of grid blocks will stay constant no matter what.

In these models, we always use basic geomechanical features without even realizing about it. That feature is rock compressibility, and it changes the pore volume based on the pressure. In general, following models can be used to mimic geomechanical features to some extend:

- Rock compressibility
- Compaction tables
- Carmen-Kozeny formula
- Dilation models, especially in thermal simulations

Real geomechanical modeling, on the other hand, incorporates the feature of deformable reservoir. In these reservoir models, pore volume can change and bulk volume can change as well, which means that the shape of grid block can change.

## Deformable Reservoir Grids

On a well scale, geomechanical models can help to answer questions about:

- Wellbore Stability
- Sand Production
- Hydraulic Fracture Propagation

On a field scale, it can help to answer:

- Fault activation and re-activation
- Prediction of subsidence and heave of a reservoir
- Maintenance of cap-rock integrity
- Effects of geomechanics on different reservoir flow properties, like porosity and permeability
- History matching 4D seismic
