### Python Essentials

Python is the best fit for the scientific computing because of the several reasons mentioned below:

- It is operating system independent; one can use the same script for Windows, Linux based systems and Mac.
- It has one of largest and fastest-growing society where you can get support wherever you are stuck.
- It is a user-friendly language; learning python is much easier than learning C or any other low-level programming language.
- It has necessary packages for scientific computation, google NumPy for array operations, SciPy for math, scikit-learn for data science, etc.
- It takes much less time to develop a program in python. Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year.
- It is free! MATLAB is not, and more often the license will limit access to your work especially when you start working in the company.
- It is more than a scientific computation tool, you can do pretty much everything with python. For example, you can develop a webpage, do image processing, program a robot, etc.
- It has all the necessary tools to perform higher computations, it can handle parallel and series computations.


### Installation

Assuming that you are using Windows not having Python installed yet, below is the link to go over the process:

- [Python Installation on Windows][python-install]

The link below will show you how to install NumPy, one of the most important modules for engineering and scientific calculations:

- [NumPy Installation for Python][numpy-install]

Besides NumPy, we will need additional modules, Matplotlib, which is a visualization package used to generate graphs and decorate them, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and SQLite. These modules can be installed pretty much the same way way you had for NumPy.
Finally, check the installation by importing those modules from a python shell, as shown in the link provided.

### Warning

There are two main differences between the syntax of Python and other languages:

- Python is a case-sensitive language, it distinguishes uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Python is indentation-sensitive, instead of curly braces, indentation is used to determine beginning and the end of code block. Do not leave unnecessary spaces at the beginning of the line of your script.


### Version Control

We are going to use git as a version control system and GitHub as an online repository for our in-class development:

- Git is version control system for tracking changes in computer files.
- It is a distributed version control system which means many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network.
- Coordinates work between multiple developers and records changes made.
- You can revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it is committed to the repository.
- GitHub is a git repository hosting service with its own features easing the access control issues and collaboration efforts.
