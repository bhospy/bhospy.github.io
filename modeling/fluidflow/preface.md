## What is matter and how to model its behavior?

- Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of transport of heat, momentum and mass.
- In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large enough to allow us to speak of phases which have distinct physical properties. We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts as a continuum.
- Most of the time, solving the problems in continuum form is sufficient enough to get accurate results.

## What is mechanics?

- Mechanics studies the motion of objects and utilizes mathematics to describe the motion of objects, rigid bodies, solids, fluids, etc.
- For real bodies, in continuum mechanics, we disregard the molecular structure of matter and picture it as being without gaps or empty spaces. We further suppose that all the mathematical functions entering the theory are continuous functions, except possibly at a finite number of interior surfaces separating regions of continuity.

## How can we describe the motion of any object?

- By utilizing the general principles of continuum mechanics:

| Conservation    | Equation             |
| --------------- |:-------------------- |
| of Mass         | Continuity Equation  |
| of Momentum     | Equation of Motion   |
| of Energy       | Equation of Energy   |

## Why should Petroleum Engineers know about Fluid Mechanics?

- Petroleum engineers deal with fluid flow all the time; it can be related to drilling or workover operations or associated with reservoir recovery.
- We are dealing with the flow of complex mixtures through the reservoir rock and through the pipelines, and in the system, there is an interaction between gases-and-liquids and liquids-and-solids.
- The basic information we might need in the analysis of such systems, pressure and velocity profiles, can be best understood with the knowledge of fluid mechanics.
- If we add insight into the thermodynamics, we can dig into the temperature profiles as well.

## Instructor's Expectations

- Admirable students will engage the course material by attending lectures, reading the course notes, asking questions, completing homework assignments on time, and devoting significant effort to the course project.
- There will be no make-up assignments and no change in due dates of the assignments. Late homework will not be accepted for a grade but you should complete all homework assignments for your own benefit.
- Complete your work independently. You are free to discuss assignments and the project with other members of the course as well as compare solutions to assignments and the project. Any work turned in for a grade, however, must represent your own original effort to solve the problem.
- Offering and accepting solutions from others is an act of plagiarism and all involved parties will be reported to the Deanâ€™s Office. You do not want a dishonesty mark to stain your record.
- This course incorporates in-class exercises that are not graded; however, they help you to apply concepts and to gauge your understanding. So, full attendance and high performance are strongly recommended.
- There is no make-up work for any missed in-class activities. No whining or lame excuses for the missed tasks.
