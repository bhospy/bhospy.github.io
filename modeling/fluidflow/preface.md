### Fluid Meachanics

What is matter and how to model its behavior?

- Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of transport of heat, momentum and mass.
- In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large enough to allow us to speak of phases with physical properties . We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts as a continuum.
- From an engineering standpoint, we are interested in solving problems in continuum form.

What is mechanics?

- Mechanics studies the motion of objects and utilizes mathematics to describe the motion of objects, rigid bodies, solids, fluids, etc.
- For real bodies, in continuum mechanics, we disregard the molecular structure of matter and picture it as being without gaps or empty spaces. We further suppose that all the mathematical functions entering the theory are continuous functions, except possibly at a finite number of interior surfaces separating regions of continuity.

How can we describe the motion of any object?

- Mass conservation, the use of equation of continuity
- Momentum conservation, the use of equation of motion
- Energy conservation, the use of equation of energy
