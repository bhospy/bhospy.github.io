<h1>What is matter and how to model its behavior?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of
transport of heat, momentum and mass.</li>
<li>In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large
enough to allow us to speak of phases which have distinct physical
properties. We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts
as a continuum.</li>
<li>Most of the time, solving the problems in continuum form is
sufficient enough to get accurate results.</li>

<div id="what-is-mechanics" class="slide section level2">
<h1>What is mechanics?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mechanics studies the motion of objects and utilizes mathematics to
describe the motion of objects, rigid bodies, solids, fluids, etc.</li>
<li>For real bodies, in continuum mechanics, we disregard the molecular
structure of matter and picture it as being without gaps or empty
spaces. We further suppose that all the mathematical functions entering
the theory are continuous functions, except possibly at a finite number
of interior surfaces separating regions of continuity.</li>

class="slide section level2">
<h1>Why should Petroleum Engineers know about Fluid Mechanics?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Petroleum engineers deal with fluid flow all the time; it can be
related to drilling or workover operations or associated with reservoir
recovery.</li>
<li>We are dealing with the flow of complex mixtures through the
reservoir rock and through the pipelines, and in the system, there is an
interaction between gases-and-liquids and liquids-and-solids.</li>
<li>The basic information we might need in the analysis of such systems,
pressure and velocity profiles, can be best understood with the
knowledge of fluid mechanics.</li>
<li>If we add insight into the thermodynamics, we can dig into the
temperature profiles as well.</li>

<h1>Instructor’s Expectations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Admirable students will engage the course material by attending
lectures, reading the course notes, asking questions, completing
homework assignments on time, and devoting significant effort to the
course project.</li>
<li>There will be no make-up assignments and no change in due dates of
the assignments. Late homework will not be accepted for a grade but you
should complete all homework assignments for your own benefit.</li>
<li>Complete your work independently. You are free to discuss
assignments and the project with other members of the course as well as
compare solutions to assignments and the project. Any work turned in for
a grade, however, must represent your own original effort to solve the
problem.</li>
<li>Offering and accepting solutions from others is an act of plagiarism
and all involved parties will be reported to the Dean’s Office. You do
not want a dishonesty mark to stain your record.</li>
<li>This course incorporates in-class exercises that are not graded;
however, they help you to apply concepts and to gauge your
understanding. So, full attendance and high performance are strongly
recommended.</li>
<li>There is no make-up work for any missed in-class activities. No
whining or lame excuses for the missed tasks.</li>
