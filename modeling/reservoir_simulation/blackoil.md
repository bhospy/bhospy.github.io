### Black Oil Simulator

The motivation is to build a Python based reservoir simulator running field scale models at high performance. Current status is the model has been running 3D structures and has been validated for two phase immiscibe flow.

PorePy contains a set of modules to model porous medium and wellbore. The modeling capabilites include flow analysis, geomechanical calculations, wellbore resisitivity computation and geostatistical estimations.
