          <div class="canvas-item">
            <h3>Python Essentials</h3>
            <p>Python is the best fit for the scientific computing because of the several reasons mentioned below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is operating system independent; one can use the same script for Windows, Linux based systems and Mac.</li>
              <li>It has one of largest and fastest-growing society where you can get support wherever you are stuck.</li>
              <li>It is a user-friendly language; learning python is much easier than learning C or any other low-level programming language.</li>
              <li>It has necessary packages for scientific computation, google NumPy for array operations, SciPy for math, scikit-learn for data science, etc.</li>
              <li>It takes much less time to develop a program in python. Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year.</li>
              <li>It is free! MATLAB is not, and more often the license will limit access to your work especially when you start working in the company.</li>
              <li>It is more than a scientific computation tool, you can do pretty much everything with python. For example, you can develop a webpage, do image processing, program a robot, etc.</li>
              <li>It has all the necessary tools to perform higher computations, it can handle parallel and series computations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Assuming that you are using Windows not having Python installed yet, below is the link to go over the process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JJ8-sCwDs4">Python Installation on Windows</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The link below will show you how to install NumPy, one of the most important modules for engineering and scientific calculations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7L72qqFtn8">NumPy Installation for Python</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides NumPy, we will need additional modules, Matplotlib, which is a visualization package used to generate graphs and decorate them, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and SQLite. These modules can be installed pretty much the same way way you had for NumPy.</p>
            <p>Finally, check the installation by importing those modules from a python shell, as shown in the link provided.</p>
            <h3>Warning</h3>
            <p>There are two main differences between the syntax of Python and other languages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python is a case-sensitive language, it distinguishes uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
              <li>Python is indentation-sensitive, instead of curly braces, indentation is used to determine beginning and the end of code block. Do not leave unnecessary spaces at the beginning of the line of your script.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Version Control</h3>
            <p>We are going to use git as a version control system and GitHub as an online repository for our in-class development:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Git is version control system for tracking changes in computer files.</li>
              <li>It is a distributed version control system which means many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network.</li>
              <li>Coordinates work between multiple developers and records changes made.</li>
              <li>You can revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it is committed to the repository.</li>
              <li>GitHub is a git repository hosting service with its own features easing the access control issues and collaboration efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Course Outline</h3>
            <p>Below is the list of topics we are going to cover in this course:</p>
            <ul>

            <p>What is matter and how to model its behavior?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Matter is composed of molecules, and they are the agents of transport of heat, momentum and mass.</li>
              <li>In many applications, however, the number of molecules is large enough to allow us to speak of phases with physical properties . We can successfully solve many problems assuming matter acts as a continuum.</li>
              <li>From an engineering standpoint, we are interested in solving problems in continuum form.</li>

            <h3>Geomechanics</h3>
            <p>Conventionally, the reservoir engineers have been using non-deformable reservoirs. In these models, pore volume can still change, but the bulk volume stays the constant, which means the shape of grid blocks will stay constant no matter what.</p>
            <p>In these models, we always use basic geomechanical features without even realizing about it. That feature is rock compressibility, and it changes the pore volume based on the pressure. In general, following models can be used to mimic geomechanical features to some extend:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rock compressibility</li>
              <li>Compaction tables</li>
              <li>Carmen-Kozeny formula</li>
              <li>Dilation models, especially in thermal simulations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Real geomechanical modeling, on the other hand, incorporates the feature of deformable reservoir. In these reservoir models, pore volume can change and bulk volume can change as well, which means that the shape of grid block can change.</p>

            <h3>Wellbore Resistivity Modeling</h3>
            <p>This model is based on solving the integral form of the Maxwell equations which uses Method of Moment technique to compute the regions of perturbed conductivity.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:10px;"> My Ph.D. research was about building an experimentally verified electromagnetic induction logging tool that can detect and appraise hydraulic fractures. The method is a promising candidate to find out the propped fracture parameters which is very important to the operation design and reserve estimation studies.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:10px;">The monitoring and diagnostics of induced fractures are important for the real-time performance evaluation of hydraulic fracturing operations. Previous electromagnetic (EM) based studies show that single backbone tri-axial induction logging tools are promising candidates for the real-time monitoring and diagnosis of fractures in non-cased wells. To support the development of field deployable tools, the concept must be tested in experiments, in a controllable environment, before it is tested under field-like conditions. To this end, we have developed numerical tools which can simulate any wellbore environment while logging hydraulic fractures with the induction tool. We have designed and built a prototype induction tool and performed two sets of tests to compare with numerical simulation results. The computational and experimental setup consists of tri-axial transmitter and receiver coils in co-axial, co-planar and cross-polarized configurations. Both lab and shallow earth measurements are shown to be in good agreement with simulations for all examined cases. The average relative and maximum discrepancies of the measured signals from the simulated ones were lower than 3% and 10%, respectively. With the prototype tool, strong signals sensitive to the fracture&#39;s surface area and dip-angle were measured in the co-axial coil configuration, while weaker signals sensitive to the fracture&#39;s aspect ratio were observed in the co-planar configuration. Cross-polarized signals are also shown to be strong and sensitive to the fracture&#39;s dip. Lastly, we resolved the detectable components of the measured signal tensor to obtain parameters of simplified fracture geometries. The developed inversion algorithm, derivative free directional search model, uses an objective function defined as a combination of co-axial and cross-polarized signals from different tool spacings to have a well behaving global minimum. The robustness of inversion algorithm is tested on synthetic data for single cluster fractures in a homogeneous and heterogeneous background electrical conductivity. All the effective model parameters for different cases, conductivity, size and dip-angle, are shown to be recovered with sufficient accuracy. We also evaluated neighbor fracture effect and suggested multi-cluster inversion path which can recover the proppant distribution in a stage very accurately. Based on the obtained numerical and experimental results we suggest a tool with specified specifications that can effectively recover far-field proppant distribution in the fractures.</p>

            <h3>Geostatistical Modeling</h3>
            <p>Oil and gas reservoirs are highly heterogeneous. To manage such reservoirs, one must learn and develop a quantitative understanding of statistics and probability. The main objective of this course is to use basic statistical concepts and methods for the characterization and modelling of spatial heterogeneity which has applications in production planning, formation evaluation and reservoir modelling. Students will be encouraged to use high level programming languages (e.g., python and MATLAB) to do the hard work.</p>
