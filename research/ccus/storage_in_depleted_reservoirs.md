# CO2 Storage in Depleted Reservoirs

Study the feasibility and safety of storing CO2 in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, assessing containment and monitoring strategies.

# Carbon Storage in Depleted Reservoirs

Carbon storage, a key strategy in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, involves the capture and secure storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) underground. One promising avenue for this endeavor is the utilization of depleted oil and gas reservoirs as repositories for CO2. This approach, known as carbon storage in depleted reservoirs, leverages existing subsurface infrastructure to safely and effectively sequester CO2, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.

## The Role of Depleted Reservoirs

Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, once productive sources of hydrocarbons, offer several advantages for carbon storage:

- **Geological Suitability**: These reservoirs possess geological characteristics, such as porosity and permeability, that make them suitable for storing CO2.

- **Infrastructure**: Depleted reservoirs often have pre-existing wells, pipelines, and infrastructure, reducing the costs and logistical challenges associated with new storage sites.

- **Enhanced Safety**: The prior extraction of hydrocarbons from these reservoirs has been thoroughly documented, providing valuable insights into their structural integrity and geological properties.

## The Carbon Storage Process

Carbon storage in depleted reservoirs typically follows a well-defined process:

### 1. Site Characterization

The process begins with a comprehensive geological and geophysical assessment of the depleted reservoir to determine its suitability for carbon storage.

### 2. Injection

CO2 is captured from industrial sources or power plants and transported to the depleted reservoir site. It is then injected into the reservoir via injection wells.

### 3. Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of the reservoir is crucial to track CO2 movement, pressure changes, and any potential leakage. This monitoring ensures the safety and effectiveness of the storage.

### 4. Storage Validation

Validation of the storage site's performance and the containment of CO2 is an ongoing process. Monitoring data is analyzed to confirm that the injected CO2 remains trapped and isolated.

## Benefits of Depleted Reservoir Storage

Carbon storage in depleted reservoirs offers a range of environmental, economic, and practical benefits:

- **Emission Reduction**: It reduces CO2 emissions by securely storing CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.

- **Carbon Neutrality**: When coupled with carbon capture technologies, it can enable carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative operations for certain industries.

- **Resource Utilization**: It repurposes existing infrastructure, extending the useful life of depleted reservoirs and reducing the need for new storage sites.

- **Enhanced Energy Security**: It contributes to energy security by safely managing depleted reservoirs and minimizing environmental risks associated with abandoned wells.

## Advancing Carbon Storage Solutions

As global efforts to combat climate change intensify, carbon storage in depleted reservoirs represents a practical and environmentally responsible approach to CO2 reduction. The utilization of these reservoirs leverages existing assets, reduces emissions, and aligns with the transition to a more sustainable energy future.

By repurposing depleted reservoirs for carbon storage, industries, and governments contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable planet while making use of proven geological formations that have served as valuable resources for decades.
