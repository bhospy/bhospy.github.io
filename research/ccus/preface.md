# Carbon Capture, Utilization, Storage

Investigating advanced CCS technologies for capturing and storing carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based power generation and industrial processes.

# Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)

As the world confronts the urgent challenge of climate change, innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are becoming increasingly vital. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is one such solution that holds great promise in the fight against global warming. CCUS is a comprehensive approach that involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from various sources, utilizing captured CO2 in beneficial ways, and securely storing it underground to prevent its release into the atmosphere.

## The Three Pillars of CCUS

CCUS consists of three interrelated pillars, each contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon future:

### 1. Carbon Capture

Carbon capture involves the extraction of CO2 emissions generated from industrial processes, power plants, and other sources before they are released into the atmosphere. Various capture technologies, such as post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion, are employed to capture CO2 from flue gases, natural gas processing, and more.

### 2. Carbon Utilization

Captured CO2 can be put to beneficial use instead of being released into the atmosphere. Carbon utilization includes a range of applications such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where CO2 is injected into depleted oil reservoirs to increase oil production, and the production of valuable chemicals and materials from CO2 feedstock.

### 3. Carbon Storage

Carbon storage, often referred to as carbon sequestration, involves securely storing captured CO2 underground in geological formations. These storage sites can include saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and deep saline formations. The aim is to ensure that the stored CO2 remains trapped and isolated from the atmosphere for long periods, mitigating its impact on global warming.

## The Role of CCUS in Climate Mitigation

CCUS plays a crucial role in climate mitigation and addressing the challenges of reducing CO2 emissions, including:

- **Emission Reduction**: CCUS significantly reduces CO2 emissions from industries and power generation, enabling the continued use of fossil fuels while minimizing their environmental impact.

- **Sustainable Industry**: CCUS allows industries to decarbonize their operations and transition to more sustainable and environmentally responsible practices.

- **Energy Transition**: CCUS provides a bridge between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources by reducing the carbon footprint of fossil fuel-based energy production.

- **Carbon Removal**: CCUS can also be a valuable tool for removing CO2 from the atmosphere, helping to balance emissions and achieve net-zero or even negative emissions.

## Advancing CCUS for a Sustainable Future

As governments, industries, and researchers worldwide intensify their efforts to combat climate change, CCUS stands as a critical technology with the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions. The development and deployment of CCUS solutions represent a path forward toward a more sustainable and resilient global energy system.
