# Well Integrity and Leakage Monitoring

Develop techniques and technologies for ensuring wellbore integrity and continuous monitoring to detect and prevent CO2 leakage.

# Well Integrity and Leakage Monitoring in Carbon Storage Projects

Carbon storage, a critical strategy for mitigating climate change, involves capturing and securely storing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from various sources underground. To ensure the safety and long-term effectiveness of carbon storage, well integrity and leakage monitoring play pivotal roles. These processes are essential for verifying that injected CO2 remains securely trapped beneath the Earth's surface and does not pose environmental or safety risks.

## The Importance of Well Integrity

Well integrity refers to the structural soundness and reliability of injection and monitoring wells used in carbon storage projects. It is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Containment**: Well integrity ensures that injected CO2 remains confined within the designated storage formation, preventing unintended migration.

- **Safety**: Well failures can lead to significant safety hazards, including groundwater contamination and surface emissions. Maintaining well integrity mitigates these risks.

- **Environmental Protection**: Protecting the environment from CO2 leakage is a fundamental goal. Well integrity is a key barrier to prevent CO2 from reaching the surface.

## Leakage Monitoring

Leakage monitoring is an ongoing process that involves detecting and assessing the potential escape of CO2 from the storage reservoir or associated infrastructure. Monitoring is essential for the following purposes:

- **Early Detection**: Detecting any leakage promptly allows for swift corrective actions, minimizing environmental and safety impacts.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with regulatory requirements often mandates continuous monitoring to ensure adherence to safety and environmental standards.

- **Data Verification**: Monitoring provides data to validate reservoir behavior and the containment of stored CO2, offering insights into storage site performance.

## Key Elements of Well Integrity and Leakage Monitoring

Effective well integrity and leakage monitoring involve a range of measures and practices:

### Well Design and Construction

Well design and construction must adhere to industry best practices and regulatory standards to ensure the structural integrity of injection and monitoring wells.

### Regular Inspections

Routine inspections and maintenance of wells are conducted to identify potential issues and address them promptly.

### Pressure and Temperature Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of reservoir pressure and temperature provides insights into reservoir behavior and helps detect anomalies.

### Fluid Sampling and Analysis

Sampling and analyzing fluids from monitoring wells can reveal changes in composition, which may indicate potential CO2 leakage.

### Geophysical and Geochemical Surveys

Geophysical and geochemical surveys, such as seismic monitoring and soil gas sampling, can detect signs of leakage in the surrounding area.

## Advancing Safe and Sustainable Carbon Storage

Well integrity and leakage monitoring are critical components of safe and sustainable carbon storage projects. These practices ensure that stored CO2 remains securely contained, safeguarding the environment and minimizing safety risks.

As carbon storage technology continues to evolve, ongoing research and innovation in well integrity and leakage monitoring are essential for enhancing the effectiveness and safety of this critical strategy in the fight against climate change.
