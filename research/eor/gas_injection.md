# Enhanced Oil Recovery by Gas Injection

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques have revolutionized the oil and gas industry, enabling the extraction of a greater percentage of hydrocarbons from reservoirs beyond what conventional methods can achieve. Among the most effective EOR methods is gas injection, where gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or natural gas, are injected into reservoirs to enhance oil recovery rates. Gas injection EOR has proven to be a versatile and environmentally sound approach to optimize hydrocarbon production.

## The Role of Gas Injection in EOR

Gas injection in EOR is employed to overcome the limitations of primary and secondary recovery methods, which often leave significant volumes of oil trapped in reservoirs. This method addresses several key challenges:

- **Reservoir Pressure Maintenance**: As oil is extracted from reservoirs, natural reservoir pressure decreases. Injecting gas helps maintain pressure, which improves oil mobility and extraction.

- **Gas Dissolution**: Injected gases, such as CO2, can dissolve in oil, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to flow through reservoir rock.

- **Gas Drive**: The injected gas acts as a drive mechanism, pushing oil towards production wells and displacing it from the reservoir.

- **Enhanced Sweep Efficiency**: Gas injection improves the sweep efficiency of injected fluids, reducing bypassed oil and increasing overall recovery.

## Types of Gas Injection EOR

There are two primary types of gas injection EOR:

- **CO2 Injection**: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most widely used gases for EOR. It dissolves in oil, reduces its viscosity, and causes oil to swell, enhancing its flow properties.

- **Natural Gas Injection**: Natural gas, primarily methane (CH4), is another gas used in EOR. It can improve oil recovery through pressure maintenance and vaporization of light hydrocarbons.

## Environmental Benefits

Gas injection EOR offers environmental advantages, including:

- **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: When CO2 is used for EOR, it can be captured from industrial emissions, contributing to carbon mitigation efforts by preventing CO2 release into the atmosphere.

- **Reduced Environmental Footprint**: Gas injection can extend the life of existing oilfields, reducing the need for new drilling and minimizing the environmental impact associated with exploration and drilling activities.

## Advancing Oilfield Productivity

Gas injection EOR is a dynamic and continually evolving field. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing gas injection strategies, reservoir modeling, and environmental sustainability. This method is instrumental in maximizing hydrocarbon production, revitalizing mature oilfields, and supporting the industry's transition toward more sustainable energy practices.

As the oil and gas industry seeks to balance energy demands with environmental responsibility, gas injection EOR stands as a critical tool to efficiently and responsibly extract hydrocarbon resources.
