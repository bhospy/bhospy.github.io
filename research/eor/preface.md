# Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR): Maximizing Hydrocarbon Extraction

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is a cutting-edge technology within the oil and gas industry that aims to maximize the extraction of hydrocarbon reserves from reservoirs. While conventional methods typically recover only a fraction of the available oil, EOR techniques employ various approaches to unlock and extract a larger portion of these valuable resources. EOR has become a critical strategy in extending the life of mature oilfields and increasing hydrocarbon production efficiency.

## The Need for Enhanced Oil Recovery

Conventional oil production methods, often referred to as primary and secondary recovery, rely on the natural pressure of the reservoir and water or gas injection to drive oil to the surface. However, these methods leave substantial amounts of oil trapped in reservoirs due to various factors, including capillary forces, reservoir heterogeneity, and fluid interactions. EOR techniques are designed to address these challenges:

- **Residual Oil**: After primary and secondary recovery, a significant amount of oil remains trapped within reservoirs. EOR methods target this residual oil and aim to mobilize and extract it.

- **Reservoir Pressure**: EOR techniques maintain or increase reservoir pressure, enhancing oil mobility and facilitating its flow toward production wells.

- **Improved Sweep Efficiency**: By modifying fluid properties or injection strategies, EOR improves the sweep efficiency of injected fluids, ensuring more effective displacement of oil.

## Types of Enhanced Oil Recovery Techniques

EOR encompasses a variety of techniques, including:

- **Thermal EOR**: This method involves injecting steam or hot fluids into the reservoir to reduce oil viscosity, improve fluid mobility, and enhance oil displacement.

- **Chemical EOR**: Chemical injection alters fluid properties, wettability, and interfacial tension to mobilize trapped oil and improve sweep efficiency.

- **Gas EOR**: Injection of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or natural gas, enhances reservoir pressure, reduces oil viscosity, and aids in oil displacement.

- **Microbial EOR**: Microorganisms are engineered to produce substances that alter reservoir conditions, making it easier to extract oil.

## Advancing Oilfield Productivity

EOR continues to evolve with ongoing research and innovations in technology, reservoir modeling, and environmental sustainability. It serves as a vital tool in extending the life of mature oilfields, maximizing hydrocarbon recovery, and aligning with the global transition toward cleaner energy sources.

As the oil and gas industry grapples with the challenges of meeting energy demands while minimizing environmental impact, EOR stands as a pivotal strategy to optimize hydrocarbon extraction and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
