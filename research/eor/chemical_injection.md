# Enhanced Oil Recovery by Chemical Injection

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) stands as a vital method within the oil and gas industry, designed to maximize the extraction of hydrocarbons from reservoirs that conventional methods cannot fully access. Among the various EOR techniques, chemical injection is a powerful and versatile approach that involves the introduction of specific chemicals into the reservoir to alter fluid properties and improve oil recovery rates. This method is instrumental in optimizing hydrocarbon production and extending the life of oilfields.

## The Role of Chemical Injection in EOR

Chemical injection in EOR is driven by the need to overcome the limitations of primary and secondary recovery methods. Primary recovery relies on natural reservoir pressure to drive oil to the surface, while secondary recovery uses water or gas injection to maintain reservoir pressure. Chemical injection complements these methods by addressing the following challenges:

- **Residual Oil**: After primary and secondary recovery, significant quantities of oil often remain trapped in the reservoir due to capillary forces and reservoir heterogeneity. Chemicals can alter the wettability of rock surfaces, reducing these trapping forces and releasing trapped oil.

- **Mobility Control**: Chemicals can modify the mobility of injected fluids, ensuring that injected water or gas efficiently sweeps through the reservoir, displacing and mobilizing oil.

- **Interfacial Tension**: Reducing the interfacial tension between oil and water can make it easier for oil to detach from reservoir rocks and flow toward production wells.

- **Water Shutoff**: In water flooding scenarios, chemicals can mitigate water channeling issues by selectively blocking water flow channels, diverting injected water to unswept portions of the reservoir.

## Types of EOR Chemicals

A wide array of chemicals is employed in EOR to achieve specific objectives:

- **Surfactants**: These chemicals reduce interfacial tension between oil and water, aiding in emulsification and mobilization of trapped oil.

- **Polymers**: Polymers increase the viscosity of injected fluids, improving sweep efficiency and reducing water production.

- **Alkaline Agents**: Alkaline agents react with acidic components in crude oil, forming surfactants in situ and altering rock wettability.

- **Microbial EOR**: Microorganisms can be engineered to produce surfactants or alter reservoir conditions, enhancing oil recovery.

## Advancing Hydrocarbon Production

Chemical injection in EOR represents a dynamic and evolving field with continuous advancements in chemical formulations, injection strategies, and reservoir modeling. It plays a pivotal role in optimizing hydrocarbon production, extending the life of mature oilfields, and increasing overall energy efficiency.

As the oil and gas industry embraces sustainability and strives to minimize environmental impact, chemical injection in EOR stands as a valuable technique for maximizing the recovery of existing resources, reducing the need for additional drilling, and aligning with the global transition to cleaner energy sources.
