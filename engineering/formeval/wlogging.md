### Well Logging

A major role of petrophysicists is to measure and evaluate rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, in which a string of measurement tools is inserted in the borehole, core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface for the laboratory measurements, and seismic measurements, in which reflected seismic waves are recorded to image subsurface structures. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical data, and reservoir engineers utilize this knowledge to describe the dynamic behavior of the reservoir. In this course, we will focus on the first way of acquiring data from underground formations and will look at the specific methodologies used in current field applications.

From the formation evaluation perspective, logging by itself cannot answer all questions, but it has certain unique advantages over the other formation evaluation techniques:

- It provides most abundant data from the formation.
- It is a reliable in-situ measurement technique providing vertical and lateral variations in rock and fluid properties.
- It is a modest cost technique.

Certain disadvantages are:

- Indirect measurement
- Limited depth of investigation
- Vertical resolution
- Nuclear hazards

### Well Log Interpretation

Interpretation steps are:

- Correlate and depth match logs
- Interpret lithology
- Identify permeable and non-permeable beds on logs
- Divide the beds into water and hydrocarbon bearing zones
- Determine the porosity
- Determine hydrocarbon saturation
