    <h2>Formation Evaluation And Monitoring</h2>

<ul>
<li>Energy Resources</li>
<li>Petrophysics Concepts</li>
<li>Upstream Engineering</li>
<li>Management Topics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formation Evaluation Methods</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mud Logging</li>
<li>Formation Evaluation While Drilling</li>
<li>Coring and Core Analysis</li>
<li>Open Hole Logging</li>
<li>Cased Hole Logging</li>
<li>Formation Testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mud Logging</h2>

<p>The mud logger’s sources of data include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gas extracted from the mud at the gas trap</li>
<li>Cuttings collected at the shale shaker</li>
<li>Gas liberated from cuttings in the blender</li>
</ul>

<p>The types of measurement possible include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total gas concentration, from either the mud or the cuttings</li>
<li>Chromatographic gas analysis</li>
<li>Visual inspection of cuttings by normal and ultraviolet light</li>
<li>Calcimetry for carbonate analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formation Evaluation While Drilling</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mostly, the MWD, measurements while drilling, name is reserved for the measurements related to well construction rather than to formation evaluation. </li>
<li>The sensors in LWD are integrated into drill collars and the logging measurements are made while the well is being drilled.</li>
<li>Both MWD and LWD systems are based on mud telemetry where pressure variations in the mud pulse exercised by the tool are sensed by a computer on surface.</li>
<li>Sometimes data may also be recorded downhole and retrieved when the drill string is removed from the hole.</li>
<li>MWD tools use accelerometer and magnetometers which measure the tool orientation with respect to the earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields and this data is then converted into wellbore inclination and direction by a surface system.</li>
<li>There are LWD sensors now available that are competitive with, and in some cases exceed, the capabilities of wireline logging sensors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Extraction</h2>

<p>Two methods of obtaining cores are frequently used:</p>

<ul>
<li>In one, an assembly called a core barrel is made up on the drill string and run to the bottom of the hole. As the core barrel is rotated, it cuts a cylindrical core a few inches in diameter that is received in a tube above the core-cutting bit. A complete round trip is required for each core taken.</li>
<li>The second is a sidewall sampler in which a small explosive charge is fired to ram a small cylinder into the wall of the hole. When the tool is pulled out of the hole, the small core samples come out with the tool. Up to thirty of the small samples can be taken at any desired depth. Either type of core can be examined in a laboratory and may reveal much about the nature of the reservoir. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Well Logging</h2>

<ul>
<li>Well logging is the practice of making a detailed record of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole. It can be either while drilling or after production started.</li>
<li>They are universally recorded in practically all wellbores and can be directly related to all the other parameters available from the associated sciences.</li>
<li>Log measurements, when properly calibrated, can provide most of the parameters required: lithology, porosity, both primary and secondary (fractures and vugs), water saturation and hydrocarbon movability, hydrocarbon type (oil, gas, or condensate), permeability, formation dip and structure, sedimentary environment, etc.</li>
<li>In producing wells, logging can provide measurements of flow rates, fluid type, pressure, residual oil saturation.</li>
<li>Logging survey can be carried while drilling (LWD) or after drilling (wireline logging).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wireline Formation Testing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enable limited samples of formation fluid to be sucked out of the formation and brought to the surface for further analysis.</li>
<li>Gauging formation permeability</li>
<li>It also enable multiple formation pressure tests to be performed in one run into the hole.</li>
<li>These can be used to compute fluid pressure gradients and thus determine precisely gas/oil, gas/water and oil/water contact regions.</li>
<li>Modern tools include quartz-crystal pressure gauges (accuracy 1 psi and resolution 0.01 psi) and pretest capabilities that allow the operator to rectify a bad seal before it leads to undesirable results.</li>
<li>Modern tools also include optical fluid analyzers which can inform the operator before sampling whether the fluid flowing from the formation is oil or water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drill Stem Testing</h2>

<ul>
<li>To ascertain whether the formation can achieve sustained production</li>
<li>To establish the type of production (oil or gas)</li>
<li>To collect formation fluids for laboratory analysis (e.g., PVT, water salinity)</li>
<li>To establish formation pressure</li>
<li>To estimate formation permeability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integrated Formation Evaluation Plan</h2>

<ul>
<li>The geophysicist must plan where to run seismic lines, quality check the actual shooting, and then interpret the data to assist in choosing a drilling location.</li>
<li>The geologist and the geochemist must work together to map the locations of traps, reservoir rocks, and source rocks. They answer the questions like where the rocks have come from (their origin), what they are made of (their composition) and how the rocks are arranged in strata.</li>
<li>The drilling engineer must plan how the well is to be drilled and supervise the drilling process and any testing or completion work.</li>
<li>The reservoir engineer must work with the petrophysicist to provide the manager with reserves figures and production-decline estimates so that logical economic decisions can be made regarding field development.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Petrophysics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Petrophysics is suggested as the term pertaining to the physics of a particular rock type, whereas geophysics pertains to the physics of larger rock systems composing the earth.</li>
<li>It studies physical and chemical rock properties; pore size distribution and their interaction with fluids; fluid distribution of each phase (oil, gas, water) within the pores of the rock.</li>
<li>The petrophysical properties that are discussed include: porosity, saturation, absolute-effective-relative permeability, capillary pressure, wettability, compressibility, mineralogy, etc.</li>
<li>Petrophysicists are employed to help reservoir engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons.</li>
<li>A key aspect of petrophysics is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, core measurements and seismic measurements.</li>
<li>These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rock Types</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Igneous Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed from molten material called magma that solidified upon cooling either at the surface or below the surface. Igneous rocks are the most abundant rocks on the Earth’s crust.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metamorphic Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed by transformation, generally in the solid state, of pre-existing rocks beneath the surface by heat, pressure, and chemically active fluids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sedimentary Rocks</strong>: These are rocks formed at the surface of the Earth either by accumulation and consolidation of minerals, rocks, organisms and vegetation, or precipitation from solution. Sedimentary rocks are the source of petroleum and provide the reservoir rock and trap to hold the petroleum in the Earth’s crust.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conventional Reservoir Rocks</h2>

<ul>
<li>A rock capable of producing oil, gas and water is called a reservoir rock.</li>
<li>To be of commercial value, a reservoir rock must have sufficient thickness, areal extent and pore space to contain a large volume of hydrocarbons and must yield the contained fluids at a satisfactory rate when the reservoir is penetrated by a well.</li>
<li>The movement of the fluids is influenced by gravity and capillary forces.</li>
<li>Sandstone and carbonates are the most common reservoir rocks. They together contain most of the world’s petroleum reserves.</li>
<li>The formation of petroleum reach rocks is a long geological process where the several crucial components are crucial.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sandstone Reservoirs</h2>

<ul>
<li>These reservoirs belong to clastic group.</li>
<li>The pore space of sandstone reservoirs can be affected by varying degrees of compaction, cementation, solution and replacement.</li>
<li>Theoretically, grain size has no effect on porosity. This is true only for spherical grains of the same size. However, the arrangement of such spheres has a large effect on the porosity of the pack.</li>
<li>Porosity is at its maximum for spherical grains but becomes progressively less as the angularity of the grains increases because such grains pack together more closely.</li>
<li>Porosities of wet packed sands show a general decrease as sorting becomes poorer. </li>
<li>Compaction and cementation decrease the porosity in the formation process of rock.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Carbonate Reservoirs</h2>

<ul>
<li>These reservoirs belong to chemical group.</li>
<li>They differ from clastic group in that they are deposited as lime particles which are produced locally, whereas sandstones are composed of particles transported from an outside source by water currents.</li>
<li>They differ even more importantly from sandstones by being subject to more post-depositional diagenesis ranging from simple cementation of original particles to complete recrystallization or replacement by dolomite or chert.</li>
<li>Diagenesis is the process of physical and chemical changes in sediments after deposition that convert them to consolidated rock such as compaction, cementation, recrystallization, and perhaps replacement of original mineral as in the development of dolomite.</li>
<li>Good porosity in carbonate reservoirs is usually due to dolomitization. Dolomitization CaMg(CO3)2 occurs from the substitution of magnesium for calcium in carbonate crystal (CaCO3). A volume loss of 12-13% results in corresponding increase in porosity.</li>
<li>Natural fractures can exist in essentially any type of rock although they are particularly common in carbonates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unconventional Reservoir Rock</h2>

<p>Unconventional reservoirs are essentially any reservoir that requires special recovery operations outside the conventional operating practices.</p>

<p>They include reservoirs such as tight-gas sands, gas and oil shales, coalbed methane, heavy oil and tar sands and gas-hydrate deposits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tight gas is the term commonly used to refer to low-permeability reservoirs that produce mainly dry natural gas.</li>
<li>Shale oil refers to hydrocarbons that are trapped in formations of shale rock.</li>
<li>Oil shale is different than shale oil in that oil shale is essentially rock that contains a compound called kerogen, which is used to make oil.</li>
<li>Coalbed methane is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds.
Tar sands (also called oil sands) are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen. Bitumen is a thick, sticky, black oil that can form naturally in a variety of ways, usually when lighter oil is degraded by bacteria.</li>
<li>Gas hydrates are ice-like crystalline minerals that form when low molecular weight gas (such as methane, ethane, or carbon dioxide) combines with water and freezes into a solid under low temperature and moderate pressure conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These reservoirs require assertive recovery solutions such as stimulation treatments or steam injection, innovative solutions that must overcome economic constraints in order to make recovery from these reservoirs monetarily viable. </p>

        <h2>Core Analysis</h2>

<p>Petrophysics has a major application in petroleum industry and is employed to help engineers and geoscientists understand the rock properties of the reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons. A major role of petrophysicists is to measure and evaluate rock properties by acquiring well log measurements, in which a string of measurement tools is inserted in the borehole, core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface for the laboratory measurements, and seismic measurements, in which reflected seismic waves are recorded to image subsurface structures. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.</p>

        <h2>Well Logging</h2>

These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical data, and reservoir engineers utilize this knowledge to describe the dynamic behavior of the reservoir. In this course, we will focus on the first way of acquiring data from underground formations and will look at the specific methodologies used in current field applications.</p>

<p>From the formation evaluation perspective, logging by itself cannot answer all questions, but it has certain unique advantages over the other formation evaluation techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>It provides most abundant data from the formation.</li>
<li>It is a reliable in-situ measurement technique providing vertical and lateral variations in rock and fluid properties.</li>
<li>It is a modest cost technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain disadvantages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indirect measurement</li>
<li>Limited depth of investigation</li>
<li>Vertical resolution</li>
<li>Nuclear hazards</li>
</ul>

<p>Interpretation steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Correlate and depth match logs</li>
