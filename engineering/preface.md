## Mud Logging

The mud logger’s sources of data include:

- Gas extracted from the mud at the gas trap
- Cuttings collected at the shale shaker
- Gas liberated from cuttings in the blender

The types of measurement possible include:

- Total gas concentration, from either the mud or the cuttings
- Chromatographic gas analysis
- Visual inspection of cuttings by normal and ultraviolet light
- Calcimetry for carbonate analysis

## Formation Evaluation While Drilling

- Mostly, the MWD, measurements while drilling, name is reserved for the measurements related to well construction rather than to formation evaluation. 
- The sensors in LWD are integrated into drill collars and the logging measurements are made while the well is being drilled.
- Both MWD and LWD systems are based on mud telemetry where pressure variations in the mud pulse exercised by the tool are sensed by a computer on surface.
- Sometimes data may also be recorded downhole and retrieved when the drill string is removed from the hole.
- MWD tools use accelerometer and magnetometers which measure the tool orientation with respect to the earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields and this data is then converted into wellbore inclination and direction by a surface system.
- There are LWD sensors now available that are competitive with, and in some cases exceed, the capabilities of wireline logging sensors.

## Core Extraction

Two methods of obtaining cores are frequently used:

- In one, an assembly called a core barrel is made up on the drill string and run to the bottom of the hole. As the core barrel is rotated, it cuts a cylindrical core a few inches in diameter that is received in a tube above the core-cutting bit. A complete round trip is required for each core taken.
- The second is a sidewall sampler in which a small explosive charge is fired to ram a small cylinder into the wall of the hole. When the tool is pulled out of the hole, the small core samples come out with the tool. Up to thirty of the small samples can be taken at any desired depth. Either type of core can be examined in a laboratory and may reveal much about the nature of the reservoir. 

## Well Logging

- Well logging is the practice of making a detailed record of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole. It can be either while drilling or after production started.
- They are universally recorded in practically all wellbores and can be directly related to all the other parameters available from the associated sciences.
- Log measurements, when properly calibrated, can provide most of the parameters required: lithology, porosity, both primary and secondary (fractures and vugs), water saturation and hydrocarbon movability, hydrocarbon type (oil, gas, or condensate), permeability, formation dip and structure, sedimentary environment, etc.
- In producing wells, logging can provide measurements of flow rates, fluid type, pressure, residual oil saturation.
- Logging survey can be carried while drilling (LWD) or after drilling (wireline logging).

## Wireline Formation Testing

- Enable limited samples of formation fluid to be sucked out of the formation and brought to the surface for further analysis.
- Gauging formation permeability
- It also enable multiple formation pressure tests to be performed in one run into the hole.
- These can be used to compute fluid pressure gradients and thus determine precisely gas/oil, gas/water and oil/water contact regions.
- Modern tools include quartz-crystal pressure gauges (accuracy 1 psi and resolution 0.01 psi) and pretest capabilities that allow the operator to rectify a bad seal before it leads to undesirable results.
- Modern tools also include optical fluid analyzers which can inform the operator before sampling whether the fluid flowing from the formation is oil or water.

## Drill Stem Testing

- To ascertain whether the formation can achieve sustained production
- To establish the type of production (oil or gas)
- To collect formation fluids for laboratory analysis (e.g., PVT, water salinity)
- To establish formation pressure
- To estimate formation permeability

## Integrated Formation Evaluation Plan

- The geophysicist must plan where to run seismic lines, quality check the actual shooting, and then interpret the data to assist in choosing a drilling location.
- The geologist and the geochemist must work together to map the locations of traps, reservoir rocks, and source rocks. They answer the questions like where the rocks have come from (their origin), what they are made of (their composition) and how the rocks are arranged in strata.
- The drilling engineer must plan how the well is to be drilled and supervise the drilling process and any testing or completion work.
- The reservoir engineer must work with the petrophysicist to provide the manager with reserves figures and production-decline estimates so that logical economic decisions can be made regarding field development.
