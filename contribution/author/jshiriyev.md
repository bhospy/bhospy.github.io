### Summary

My research revolves around studying fluid flow modeling through porous media, including the problems associated with uncertainty handling in data collection and model incorporation. I acquire the rudiments of mechanics and the basics of data science and have taught fluid and rock mechanics, reservoir characterization and petrophysics-related courses. Besides teaching, currently, I am also involved in the field development planning for Gum-Daniz and Bahar fields.
